# OrbMech-project
 Interplanetary mission assignment:
The PoliMi Space Agency is carrying out a feasibility study for a potential Interplanetary Explorer Mission visiting three planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Earth and Mercury. The focus of the study is to analyse all the possible transfer options from Jupiter to Mercury, using a powered gravity assist around the Earth, and determining the optimal departure, fly-by and arrival dates to minimize the cost of the mission (Δ𝑣).

Planetary mission assignment:
The PoliMi Space Agency plans to launch an Earth observation satellite. This study examines the proposed orbit and the ground track of the spacecraft, the effects of the presence of the Moon and the 𝐽2 perturbation. A repeating ground track is desired and a method to achieve it is therefore presented. Two different numerical orbital propagation methods are used, and the results are compared and discussed.

This project was carried out with three other colleagues.
